VCS® is a high-performance, high-capacity Verilog® simulator that incorporates advanced, high-level abstraction verification technologies into a single open native platform.

VCS is a compiled code simulator. It enables you to analyze, compile, and simulate Verilog, SystemVerilog, OpenVera and SystemC design descriptions. It also provides you with a set of simulation and debugging features to validate your design. These features provide capabilities for source-level debugging and simulation result viewing.

VCS  accelerates complete system verification by delivering the fastest and highest capacity Verilog simulation for RTL functional verification.
