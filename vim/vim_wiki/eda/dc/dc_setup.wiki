=Setup, Libraries and Objects=

==Variables==
* Target Library Variable
  - The target library is the library used by DC for building a circuit during compile

  - During mapping, DC will:
    Choose functionally-correct gates from this library
    Calculate the timing of  the circuit using vendor-supplied timing data for these gates

  - target_library is a reserved variable in DC:
    Set it to point to the library file provided by your silicon vendor
            set target_library my_tech.db

* Link Library Variable
  - Used to resolve leaf-cells and subdesign references:
        set link_library "* my_tech.db"

  - DC reads the libraries specified in the `link_library` variable during a read command

  - When linking a design, DC searches memory first, then searches the library files specified in the `link_library` variable

  - DC searches all Unix directories defined in the `search_path` variable

* Search Path Variable


==Setup==
* Initialization Files
  Commands in .synopsys_dc.setup are executed upon tool startup.
  - Standard Setup
    $/SYNOPSYS/admin/setup/.synopsys_dc.setup
  - User's General Setup
    $HOME/.synopsys_dc.setup
  - User's Specific Project Setup
    PJ_Dir/.synopsys_dc.setup

* 

==Object==
  Design, Cell, Net, Pin, Port, Clock

* `get_*` command
  - Return objects in the `current_design`
    Can be used stand-alone or composed with other functions
  - Objects may be used together with the * wildcard
    set_load 5 [get_ports addr_bus*]
    set_load 6 [get_ports "A* B*"]
  - "get_*" commands return a collection of design objects
    If no matching, an empty collection is returned
  - Other primary get commands:
    `get_cells`         cells or instances
    `get_clocks`        clocks
    `get_designs`       designs
    `get_libs`          libraries
    `get_lib_cells`     library cells
    `get_lib_pins`      library cell pins
    `get_nets`          nets
    `get_pins`          pins
    `get_ports`         ports
  - Other handy list commands
    # List all input and inout ports
      `all_inputs`
    # List all output and inout ports
      `all_outputs`
    # List all designs in DC memory
      `get_design *`
    # List all designs under the current design, but not the current design itself
      `get_design -hierarchy *`
