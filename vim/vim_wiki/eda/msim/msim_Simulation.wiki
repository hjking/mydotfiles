== Simulation Flow ==
The following table provides a reference for the tasks required for compiling, optimizing, loading, and simulating a design in [[../msim][ModelSim]].

== Basic Steps for Simulation ==
=== Step 1 -- Collecting Files and Mapping Libraries ===
  # Design Files(verilog, etc)
  # Libraries(working and resource)
    - Creating the logical library(vlib)
      `vlib work`
    - Mapping the logical work to the physical work library(vmap)
     `vmap <logical_lib> <dir_path_name>`
  # Stimulus for the design
    Stimulus can be provided in several ways:
    - Language based test bench
    - Tcl-based [[../msim][ModelSim]] interactive command
    - VCD files/command
    - 3rd party test bench generation tools

=== Step 2 -- Compiling the Design ===
  # Compiling Verilog([[vlog][vlog]])
  # Compiling VHDL(vcom)
  # Compiling SystemC(sccom)

=== Step 3 -- Load the Design for Simulation ===
  Invoke [[vsim][vsim]] with the names of the top-level modules

  `vsim top_module`

  The design can be optimized with [[vopt][vopt]].

=== Step 4 -- Simulation the Design ===
  Once the design has been successfully loaded, the simulation time is set to zero, and you must enter a run command to begin simulation.

  The basic simulator commands are:
    - [[add wave][add wave]]
    - [[force][force]]
    - [[bp][bp]]
    - [[run][run]]
    - [[step][step]]

=== Step 5 -- Debugging the Design ===
  The basic simulator debugging commands are:
    - describe
    - drivers
    - examine
    - force
    - log
    - checkpoint
    - restore
    - show

== Mode of Operation ==
  - GUI Mode(default)
    Interactive; has graphical windows, push-buttons, menus, and a command line in the transcript.
    via a desktop icon or input *vsim* in the OS command shell prompt.

  - CLI Mode
    Interactive command line
    Input *vsim -c* in the OS command prompt.

  - Batch Mode
    Non-interactive batch script; no windows or interactive command line.
