;;; Commentary:

;; Motions describe functions moving the cursor or representing an
;; argument for an operator. There are three types of motions:
;; character-wise, line-wise and block-wise. Usually only the first
;; two types are represented by motion-commands while the last one is
;; implicitly used by visual-block-mode.
;;
;; A motion is defined using the macro 'vim:defmotion' which has the
;; following form:
;; 
;; (vim:defmotion name (count 
;;                      argument[:{char}] 
;;                      {inclusive,exclusive,linewise,block}) 
;;   body...)
;;
;; Each of the arguments is optional. The names of the arguments must
;; be exactly as in the definition above (but see 'Argument-renaming'
;; below).
;;
;; The COUNT argument (if given) takes the count of the motion which
;; is usually the number how often the motion should be repeated. This
;; argument may be nil if no count is given.
;;
;; The ARGUMENT argument is an aditional text-argument to be given and
;; may be nil, too. If it is specified as ARGUMENT:CHAR, the argument
;; is a one-character argument (see `vim:motion-find' usually bound to
;; 'f' for an example), otherwise it's a string-argument. Currently all
;; motions taking an argument take a character-argument.
;;
;; One if the pseudo-arguments INCLUSIVE, EXCLUSIVE, LINEWISE and BLOCK
;; must be given and specifies the type of the motion. See the Vim-manual
;; for an explanation of motion-types.
;;
;; If you do not like the default argument names, they may be renamed by using
;; (ARG NEWNAME) instead of ARG, e.g.
;;
;;   (vim:defmotion vim:motion-find (inclusive count (argument:char arg))
;;
;; defines an inclusive motion with a count-argument but renames the 
;; character-argument to ARG.
;;
;; Each motion should return an object of type `vim:motion'. This may happen
;; in one of two ways: explicit or implicit. 
;;
;; Explicit: The function creates an object of type `vim:motion' using
;; `vim:make-motion' specifing the begin position, the end position
;; and the type of the motion (overriding the motion-type specified in
;; the argument list). If the motion is a usual motion, the vim:motion
;; parameter :has-begin should be nil, if it's a text-objects it
;; should be t. The difference is that text-objects actively define a
;; range from the begin-position to the end-position, while
;; conventional motions define only the end-position placing begin at
;; (point). The motion should also change (point) usually to the
;; end-position of the returned motion.
;;
;; Implicit: Creating an explicit `vim:motion' object is overkill for
;; most simple motions. If the motion does not return a `vim:motion'
;; object, its created implicitly with the following rules: 
;;   - the begin-position is set to (point) before the execution of motion's 
;;     body
;;   - the end-position is set to (point) after the execution of motion's
;;     body
;;   - :has-begin is nil 
;;   - the type is the type defined in the motion's argument list
;; Almost all motions defined in this file are implicit.
;;
;; Note that, independently on whether the motion is defined
;; implicitly or explicitly, calling a motion always returns a
;; `vim:motion' object, i.e. (vim:motion-p (vim:motion-left)) would
;; return t.
;;
;; Motions can be bound to some key-sequence as any other interactive
;; Emacs function, but they work only in vim-mode. Ususally motions
;; are bound to the operator-pending-mode keymap using `vim:omap'.
