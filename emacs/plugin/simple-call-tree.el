;;; Commentary:

;; This code analyses a buffer and uses text properties to find
;; function names (these have the face font-lock-function-name-face).
;; Therefore, it should work for any source language, as long as it is
;; fontified correctly.

;;; Code:

The result is stored in `simple-call-tree-alist'.

called with one parameter, the starting position of the function
name."
