;;; Commentary:
;;
;; planner-timeclock-summary-proj.el produces timeclock reports for planner
;; files.  That package uses `timeclock-project-alist' and
;; `timeclock-seconds-to-string' from timeclock.

;; To use, call `planner-timeclock-summary-proj-current' from a
;; project page. The report is inserted at the current position in the
;; buffer. The function `planner-timeclock-summary-proj-section' does
;; the same but the report is inserted inside a section called "*
;; Report".

;; You might want to add
;;
;; (planner-timeclock-summary-proj-insinuate)
;;
;; to your planner config, which will cause the timeclock summary to
;; be updated every time a Planner file is written.

;;; Contributors

;; Trent Buck overhauled the code for Planner-Muse.

;; Marko Sch√ºtz provided a bugfix.
