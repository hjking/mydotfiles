;;; Commentary:

;; Dynamic abbrev for multiple selection using `anything', and partial dabbrev.
;; This package is tested on Emacs 22.

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below are complete command list:
;;
;;  `anything-dabbrev-expand'
;;    The command does dynamic abbrev expansion for multiple selection using `anything'.
;;  `anything-dabbrev-find-all-buffers'
;;    Display dabbrev candidates in all buffers.
;;
;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below are customizable option list:
;;

;;; Installation:

;; Put this file into your load-path, and add following line to .emacs.
;;
;;   (require 'anything-dabbrev-expand)
;;   (global-set-key "\M-/" 'anything-dabbrev-expand)
;;   (define-key anything-dabbrev-map "\M-/" 'anything-dabbrev-find-all-buffers)

;;; Usage:

;; anything-dabbrev-expand behaves as follows.
;;
;; (1) First, execute `anything-dabbrev-expand'.
;;     And this function behaves as well as normal dabbrev-expand.
;; (2) Next, execute `anything-dabbrev-expand' again.
;;     Then `anything' selection menu appears.
;;     It contains dabbrev candidates in current buffer (partial match).
;; (3) After waiting for `anything-dabbrev-idle-delay' seconds in selection menu,
;;     It searches dabbrev candidates from all buffers.
;;
;;     or
;; (3')execute `anything-dabbrev-find-all-buffers' in selection menu.
;;     It searches dabbrev candidates from all buffers.

;;; Note:

;; The main idea of this package is based on dabbrev-expand-multiple.el.
;; dabbrev-expand-multiple.el has Copyright to khiker.

;; This package requires Ruby interpreter. <URL:http://www.ruby-lang.org/>

;;; Customize:

;; You can customize `anything-dabbrev-expand' strategy.
;; See `anything-dabbrev-expand-strategies' docstring.
