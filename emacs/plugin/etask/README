===============================================
EtaskMode  --  Task Management within GNU Emacs
===============================================

Development Environment: GNU Emacs 21.3, Debian/testing Linux
distribution

This file is part of EtaskMode, Test Releases `0.3.xxx'.



FAILURE REPORTS
===============

If you encounter failures in this release, please report them; your
failure reports are valuable contributions, since they allow us
to notice and fix problems on machines we don't have, or in code we
don't use often.


--------------------------------------------
Please report failures by electronic mail to

<rene (dot) mas (at) chello (dot) at>


You can use the EtaskMode command `C-c C-b'
to submit a bug report.
--------------------------------------------


To enable maintainers to investigate a failure, your report should
include all these things (items with a * are collected automatically
if you use `C-c C-b' from within EtaskMode):

 * The version number of EtaskMode (variable `etask-release').

 * The version number of Emacs (variable `emacs-version').

 * The files in your EtaskMode working directory.

 * Your operating system type (variable `system-type').

 * The features that are present in your Emacs (variable `features').

 * The backtrace for the failure, if possible (do `M-x
   toggle-debug-on-error').

 + A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
   incorrect.

 + A complete list of any modifications you have made to the EtaskMode
   and Emacs source, if any.

 + The precise commands we need to type to reproduce the bug.



SETUP
=====


1. Install missing software components:  
      

   Emacs extensions: 

     calendar, timezone, cal-iso, highlight-current-line (optionally)


   Other tools: 

     Software to generate high-quality Gantt charts from a LaTeX file,
     e.g. LaTeX, dvips, ps2pdf, and xpdf


   LaTeX packages: 

     ae, babel, inputenc, fontenc, eurosym, amssymb, pst-all, fancyhdr


2. Place the downloaded *.el files in your load path or add their
   directory to the load path.

   To find out what your load path is type (without quotes): `C-h v
   load-path' 

   To add, for example, the directory ``mylisp'' of your home
   directory to the load path put the following in your ``~/.emacs'':
   (setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name ``~/mylisp'') load-path))


3. Load EtaskMode:

   Put the following in your ``~/.emacs'': (require 'etask)

   Save your ``~/.emacs'' and re-read it by typing
   `M-x load-file RET ~/.emacs RET'


4. Preliminary EtaskMode configuration

   Type `M-x customize-group RET etask RET' to customize the main
   group.

   You should also go through the subgroups (Finetuning, Screen, and
   LaTeX) and set your preferences -- for example, the number of
   working hours per day, the paper size for the LaTeX outputs, and
   many more.

   If you want to change the faces used within the EtaskMode window do
   `M-x customize-group RET etaskfaces RET'


5. Migration from 0.1.xxx to 0.2.xxx and later releases

5.1 Customization

   If you have customized the following variables please delete the
   settings from your ``~/.emacs'':

   >  etask-tasks-filename
   >  etask-reports-filename-prefix
   >  etask-tex-filename-prefix
   >  etask-logfile
   >  etask-controlfile

5.2 Tasks file

a) Choose a <project name> for your tasks.

   `M-x etask'

   `M-x etask-migrate-01-02'

   Enter full path name of your tasks file

   Enter <project name>

   `C-c a' (administration)

   `1' (choose project)

   `1' (choose new project name)

   Enter your <project name>


b) If you encounter problems with the automatic migration, you can do
   the following:

   Choose a <project name> for your tasks.

   Rename your tasks file to "projects.<project name>" and put it in
   the working directory (customize variable `etask-working-dir').

   Change the project entries in projects.<project name> from "no
   project" to your "<project name>".  
   You can do this with dired: 
   - `M-x dired' or `C-x d'
   - Dired directory = working directory
   - Move cursor over file projects.<project name> and do 
     `Q no project RET <project name>'

   Within EtaskMode, do `C-c a', select (1) Project, (1) New, and
   enter your new project <project name>.

   After that, you should see a chart containing the migrated tasks.



TUTORIAL
========

EtaskMode is accompanied by a tutorial (etasktut.pdf).
